# Check-Validate-E-Mail-Address-in-Python
Email Validation Script This Python script validates an email address based on several conditions. The conditions ensure that the email address follows a standard format and includes necessary components like alphabetic characters, the "@" symbol, and a username name.


How It Works
The script follows these validation steps:

Length Check: The email must be at least 6 characters long.
First Character Check: The first character of the email must be an alphabet letter.
"@" Check: The email must contain exactly one "@" symbol.
Domain Check: The email must have a "." either three or four characters from the end.
Character Validation: The script checks each character in the email to ensure:
There are no spaces.
There are no uppercase letters.
Only valid characters are used (letters, digits, underscores, periods, and the "@" symbol).
